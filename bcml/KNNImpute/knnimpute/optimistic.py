    """
    Fill in the given incomplete matrix using k-nearest neighbor imputation.

    This version assumes that most of the time the same neighbors will be
    used so first performs the weighted average of a row's k-nearest neighbors
    and checks afterward whether it was valid (due to possible missing values).

    Has been observed to be a lot faster for 1/4 missing images matrix
    with 1000 rows and ~9000 columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : np.ndarray
        Matrix to fill of shape (n_samples, n_features)

    missing_mask : np.ndarray
        Boolean array of same shape as X

    k : int

    verbose : bool

    Modifies X by replacing its missing values with weighted averages of
    similar rows. Returns the modified X.
