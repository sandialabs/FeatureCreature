    """
    Fill in the given incomplete matrix using k-nearest neighbor imputation.

    This version is a simpler algorithm meant primarily for testing but
    surprisingly it's faster for many (but not all) dataset sizes, particularly
    when most of the columns are missing in any given row. The crucial
    bottleneck is the call to numpy.argpartition for every missing element
    in the array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : np.ndarray
        Matrix to fill of shape (n_samples, n_features)

    missing_mask : np.ndarray
        Boolean array of same shape as X

    k : int

    verbose : bool

    Returns a row-major copy of X with imputed values.
